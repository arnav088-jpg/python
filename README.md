# python 
Task 1 EXPLANATION
a1=input("Enter the first number: ")
 first number as a string input.

a2=input("Enter the second number: ")
 second number as a string input.

a1=float(a1) and a2=float(a2)
Convert the string inputs to floating numbers so math can be done.

a = a1 + a2
—Addition of the two numbers.

b = a1 - a2
—Subtraction of the second number from the first.

c = a1 * a2
— Multiplication of the two numbers.

d = a1/a2
Division of the first number by the second.

print(...)


TASK 2 EXPLANATION
